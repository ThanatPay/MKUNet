Images from 60 cases diagnosed with PTC in the Department of Pathology, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital by pathologists according to the WHO classification criteria of Endocrine and Neuroendocrine Tumours (5th ed.), which included images of cancer and normal tissues. Images with 40x magnification from cancer slides were captured in terms of cancer parts and normal tissues in the same case. In each case, 10 to 20 images of PTC were captured, and 10 to 20 images of benign thyroid (normal thyroid tissues) were captured similarly. All captured image samples were examined by pathologists. The total numbers of images of PTC and benign thyroid were 286 and 313, respectively, as shown in Figs. 8 and 9. Additionally, the sub-centimeter PTC images are occasionally captured at a low magnification, which may be easily overlooked by the pathologistsâ€™ eyes; we call this small PTC. The total images of the small PTC were 27 images![image](https://github.com/ThanatPay/SemanticSegmentation/assets/106669802/60524b74-de06-4ba4-a271-16c2dddc834c)
